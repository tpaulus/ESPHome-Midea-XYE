# XYE/CCM Protocol Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the Midea XYE/CCM RS-485 protocol used for communication between thermostats and HVAC units. The protocol uses a master-slave architecture where the thermostat (client) initiates communication and the HVAC unit (server) responds.

## Physical Layer

- **Interface**: RS-485 differential signaling (X is A, Y is B, E is GND)
- **Baud Rate**: 4800 bps
- **Data Format**: 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
- **Bus**: Half-duplex
- **Architecture**: Master/slave - CCM (master) polls all possible 64 unit IDs
- **Timing**: 130ms time slice per unit (30ms query + 100ms timeout for response)

## Message Structure

All messages start with a preamble byte (0xAA) and end with a CRC byte followed by a prologue byte (0x55).

### Node Addressing

- **Device IDs**: 0x00 to 0x3F (64 possible unit addresses)
- **Broadcast ID**: 0xFF (messages sent to all units)
- **Master ID**: Typically 0x00 (CCM/thermostat)

### Receive Messages (Server → Client)

**Length**: 32 bytes

```
Byte    Field               Description

                            Messages are distinguished by context and command type, not this byte.

                            status flag unrelated to the temperature — it must be masked out
                            with SET_TEMP_VALUE_MASK (0xBF) before interpreting the value.

                            (see "Byte 27-29 observations" below).

```

### Byte 19 observation

- **Byte 19 (`Compressor Run Flag`)** — provisional compressor-running flag.
  In paired heat-mode captures from one system, C0 byte 19 was `0x01` while the
  compressor was running and `0x00` while the unit was idling, while the C4
  `compressor_flags` field stayed at `0x8C` (compressor active, outdoor fan
  running, no protections) and C0 bytes 28-29 (`0xE0/0x01`) stayed
  unchanged. This needs validation on more hardware before being treated as
  universal.

### Byte 27-29 observations

These three bytes are not yet decoded. Cross-referencing independent captures
yields the following partial picture:

- **Byte 27 (`Unknown4`)** — hardware-dependent, steady within a given device.
  `0x00` across 771 C0 responses on a ducted heat pump in the US Pacific
  Northwest; `0x14` across dozens of C0 responses on a C&H CH-36AHU
  (Midea-manufactured; Home Assistant community thread
  ["Midea A/C via Local XYE"](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/midea-a-c-via-local-xye/),
  mdrobnak). Likely a capability / model-class byte.
- **Byte 28 (`Unknown5`)** — *not* a static status word and *not* a monotonic
  counter. A ~22-minute idle capture from a PNW ducted heat pump recorded 7
  distinct values drifting up *and* down:

  ```
  0xE0 → 0xD0 → 0xC2 → 0xBE → 0xBA → 0xAE → 0xB0
  (decimal: 224, 208, 194, 190, 186, 174, 176)
  ```

  The value can sit on a single setting for many minutes (the `0xE0` run was
  ~11 minutes in that capture) then step by a few counts. A C&H CH-36AHU
  capture recorded much more rapid movement through 0x00..0xFF.

  A second PNW capture (109 C0 frames, 3m 43s) deliberately exercised four
  user-initiated state transitions (OFF → FAN → COOL @ 20°C → COOL @ 22°C)
  and byte 28 **did not move** — it stayed at `0xE0` through every
  transition, as did byte 27 (`0x00`) and byte 29 (`0x01`). So byte 28 is
  **not coupled to `operation_mode` or `target_temperature`** on the
  user-command timescale. Whatever drives it, HVAC setpoint controls are
  not an input. Best remaining hypotheses: an internal sensor reading
  (compressor discharge? evaporator pressure?), a defrost / protection
  countdown, or some non-user-facing controller state.
  A separate pair of heat-mode captures also held bytes 28-29 steady at
  `0xE0/0x01` while byte 19 toggled between compressor running (`0x01`) and
  idle (`0x00`), so byte 28 is also **not coupled to compressor start/stop**
  on the observed timescale.
- **Byte 29 (`Unknown6`)** — hardware-dependent steady state: `0x01` across
  all 771 PNW frames; alternates `0x00`/`0x01` with occasional `0x02` on the
  C&H unit. Meaning unclear.

Any of these interpretations is provisional until more hardware is captured.

## Commands

Commands are sent from the client (thermostat) to the server (HVAC unit):

```
Command             Value   Description
-------             -----   -----------
QUERY               0xC0    Query current status (basic)
QUERY_EXTENDED      0xC4    Query extended status (outdoor temp, static pressure)
SET                 0xC3    Set operation parameters (mode, fan, temperature)
FOLLOW_ME           0xC6    Send remote temperature reading for Follow-Me feature
LOCK                0xCC    Lock physical controls
UNLOCK              0xCD    Unlock physical controls
```

The server responds with the same command code.

## Operation Modes

```
Mode        Value   Description                 Notes
----        -----   -----------                 -----
OFF         0x00    Unit is off                 
AUTO        0x80    Automatic mode              
AUTO_ALT    0x91    Automatic mode (alternate)  Observed in some implementations (0x80 | 0x10 | 0x01)
FAN         0x81    Fan only mode               Derived from AUTO (0x80 | 0x01)
DRY         0x82    Dehumidify mode             Derived from AUTO (0x80 | 0x02)
HEAT        0x84    Heating mode                Derived from AUTO (0x80 | 0x04)
COOL        0x88    Cooling mode                Derived from AUTO (0x80 | 0x08)
```

**Note**: Some implementations use AUTO_ALT (0x91 = 0x80 | 0x10 | 0x01), which includes the OP_MODE_AUTO_FLAG (0x10). The exact encoding may vary by unit model.

**Important — AUTO mode and the indoor unit**: The indoor unit hardware **never** reports AUTO in its C0 response. When the user selects AUTO (heat/cool as needed), the thermostat (CCM/ESPHome) is responsible for comparing the room temperature to the setpoint and switching between HEAT and COOL commands. The AC itself always receives an explicit HEAT or COOL command and reports back that mode. A software "smart thermostat" layer (e.g. the [HASS Smart Climate](https://github.com/HomeOps/HASS-Smart-Climate) component) is required to implement the AUTO logic in Home Assistant.

## Fan Modes

```
Mode        Value   Description                 Notes
----        -----   -----------                 -----
FAN_OFF     0x00    Fan off                     
FAN_HIGH    0x01    High speed                  
FAN_MEDIUM  0x02    Medium speed                
FAN_LOW_ALT 0x03    Low speed (alternate)       Observed in some implementations
FAN_LOW     0x04    Low speed                   
FAN_AUTO    0x80    Automatic fan speed         Bit 7 set; lower nibble may encode current physical speed (see below)
```

**Note**: Low fan speed has been observed as both FAN_LOW_ALT (0x03) and FAN_LOW (0x04) in different implementations. Use the value that works with your specific unit.

### Fan Mode Bitmask (received from AC)

The fan mode byte returned by the AC in the C0 response is a **bitmask**:

- **Bit 7 (`0x80`)** — AUTO fan flag: set when the unit is controlling fan speed automatically.
- **Lower nibble (`0x0F`)** — Current physical speed the fan is actually running at (uses the same FAN_HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW encoding above).

When the unit is in AUTO fan mode it reports combined values:

| Value  | Meaning                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `0x80` | Auto fan, no current speed info      |
| `0x81` | Auto fan, currently running at High  |
| `0x82` | Auto fan, currently running at Medium|
| `0x84` | Auto fan, currently running at Low   |

To decode:
- Check bit 7 (`value & 0x80`) to determine if the unit is in auto-fan mode.
- Mask the lower nibble (`value & 0x0F`) to get the current physical speed.

In this implementation `FAN_AUTO_FLAG = 0x80` and `FAN_SPEED_MASK = 0x0F` are defined as named constants.

## Temperature Encoding

### Celsius Encoding (Default)
```
encoded_value = (celsius * 2.0) + 0x28
celsius = (encoded_value - 0x28) / 2.0
```

**Note**: An alternative formulation (`(celsius / 0.5) + 0x30`) appears in the codeberg.org/xye/xye reference. This is **incorrect** — `0x30 = 48` while `0x28 = 40`, so the codeberg formula produces values that are 8 raw counts (4 °C) too high. Always use the `+ 0x28` formula.

**Example**: 
- 20°C → (20 * 2) + 0x28 = 0x50 (80 decimal)
- 0x50 → (80 - 40) / 2.0 = 20°C

### Fahrenheit Encoding
Some implementations send raw Fahrenheit values directly without encoding. The behavior may depend on unit configuration or regional settings.

**Special Value**:
- `0xFF`: Used in FAN mode when temperature control is not applicable

## Mode Flags

Special operation modes (byte 11 in transmit, byte 20 in receive):

```
Flag            Value   Description
----            -----   -----------
NORMAL          0x00    Normal operation
ECO             0x01    Energy saving mode
AUX_HEAT        0x02    Auxiliary heat / Turbo mode
SWING           0x04    Swing/oscillation mode
VENTILATION     0x88    Ventilation mode
```

## Timer Flags

Timer values are encoded as combinable bit flags (bytes 9-10 in transmit, bytes 17-18 in receive):

```
Flag            Value   Duration
----            -----   --------
TIMER_15MIN     0x01    15 minutes
TIMER_30MIN     0x02    30 minutes
TIMER_1HOUR     0x04    1 hour
TIMER_2HOUR     0x08    2 hours
TIMER_4HOUR     0x10    4 hours
TIMER_8HOUR     0x20    8 hours
TIMER_16HOUR    0x40    16 hours
INVALID         0x80    Timer not set/invalid
```

Flags can be combined to create specific durations. For example:
- 1.5 hours = TIMER_1HOUR | TIMER_30MIN = 0x06
- 3 hours = TIMER_2HOUR | TIMER_1HOUR = 0x0C

## Operation Flags

Status flags from the unit (byte 21 in receive):

```
Flag            Value   Description
----            -----   -----------
WATER_PUMP      0x04    Water pump is active
WATER_LOCK      0x80    Water lock protection is active
```

## Capabilities Flags

Unit capability flags (byte 7 in receive):

```
Flag            Value   Description
----            -----   -----------
EXTERNAL_TEMP   0x80    Supports external temperature sensor (Follow-Me)
SWING           0x10    Supports swing/oscillation function
```

## Error and Protection Flags

Error flags are reported as a 16-bit value across bytes 22-23:
- Byte 22: Error flags low byte (E1 error codes)
- Byte 23: Error flags high byte (E2 error codes)

Protection flags are reported as a 16-bit value across bytes 24-25:
- Byte 24: Protection flags low byte
- Byte 25: Protection flags high byte

The exact meaning of individual error codes varies by unit model and requires the service manual.

## CCM Communication Error Flags

Communication error flags (byte 26 in receive):

```
Flag            Value   Description
----            -----   -----------
NO_ERROR        0x00    No communication errors
TIMEOUT         0x01    Communication timeout
CRC_ERROR       0x02    CRC check failed
PROTOCOL_ERROR  0x04    Protocol violation
```

## CRC Calculation

The CRC is a simple checksum calculated as follows:

```
1. Sum all bytes in the message EXCEPT the CRC byte and prologue
2. Take the least significant byte of the sum (sum & 0xFF)
3. CRC = 0xFF - (sum & 0xFF)
```

**Example** (16-byte transmit message):
```c
uint8_t crc = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) {  // Bytes 0-13 (exclude CRC at 14 and prologue at 15)
    crc += message[i];
}
message[14] = 0xFF - crc;  // Store CRC
message[15] = 0x55;        // Store prologue
```

## Follow-Me Subcommands

When using the FOLLOW_ME (0xC6) command, byte 10 contains a subcommand:

```
Subcommand          Value   Description
----------          -----   -----------
UPDATE              0x02    Regular temperature update
STOP                0x04    Follow-Me stop / end-of-sequence marker (present in static pressure frames)
INIT                0x06    Initialization after mode change
```

### Static Pressure (ESP Profile) Frames

To set the external static pressure profile, byte 8 of the C6 frame encodes the profile level in the **lower nibble**, with bit 4 (`0x10`) always set:

```
Byte 8  Profile   Description
------  -------   -----------
0x10    SP0       Lowest static pressure profile
0x11    SP1
0x12    SP2
0x13    SP3
0x14    SP4       Highest static pressure profile
```

Byte 10 in these frames contains `0x04` (STOP), which is the Follow-Me stop flag — not a separate "static pressure subcommand".

### Emergency Heat Frame

To activate aux/emergency heat (backup heat strip only, compressor bypassed), send a C6 frame with **byte 8 = `0x80`** immediately after the C3 SET command.

## Communication Flow

### Polling Architecture
The master (CCM/thermostat) uses a polling model:
1. Master polls all 64 possible unit IDs (0x00 to 0x3F) sequentially
2. Each unit gets a 130ms time slice:
   - 30ms for sending query/command
   - 100ms timeout waiting for response
3. Units only respond when addressed by their specific ID
4. Broadcast messages (0xFF) are received by all units but typically don't generate responses

### Basic Query Cycle
1. Client sends QUERY (0xC0) command to specific unit ID
2. Server responds with current status (if ID matches)
3. Client processes response
4. Continue polling next unit ID or repeat after delay

### Setting Parameters
1. Client sends SET (0xC3) command with new parameters
2. Server acknowledges and applies settings
3. Server responds with updated status
4. Client may send QUERY to confirm changes

### Broadcast Commands
1. Client sends command with destination ID = 0xFF
2. All units receive and process the command
3. No response expected from units
4. Useful for simultaneous updates to all units

### Follow-Me Operation
1. Client sends FOLLOW_ME (0xC6) with room temperature
2. Server uses client temperature instead of internal sensor
3. Client sends updates when temperature changes
4. Client sends periodic updates (every 30 seconds) to maintain Follow-Me mode

## Implementation Notes

### Timing Considerations
- Master polls with 130ms time slice per unit (30ms send + 100ms timeout)
- Allow 100-200ms for HVAC unit to respond to commands
- Wait for response before sending next command to avoid bus collisions
- Query status periodically (10-15 seconds) to maintain communication
- Send Follow-Me updates every 30 seconds minimum

### Error Handling
- Validate preamble (0xAA) and prologue (0x55) on received messages
- Verify CRC before processing message data
- Implement timeout for responses (typically 500ms-1s)
- Retry failed commands with exponential backoff

### Multi-Unit Systems
- The bus supports up to 64 units with IDs 0x00 to 0x3F
- Each unit must have a unique node ID
- Master polls all possible IDs sequentially (even if no unit is present)
- Address specific units by setting the destination ID (byte 2) in transmit messages
- Use broadcast ID (0xFF) to send commands to all units simultaneously
- Monitor bus for responses to identify which units are present on the system

## Known Issues and Variations

### Direction Flag (Byte 2)
- Some legacy/third-party protocol documentation (and some early tables) describe a direction flag bit, with 0x80 used for frames sent from the master and 0x00 for frames from the AC
- Actual on-wire traffic for XYE/CCM units shows byte 2 as 0x00 for both requests (master → AC) and responses (AC → master)
- This implementation always transmits 0x00 in byte 2 and expects 0x00 in responses, matching observed AC behavior
- Any references to 0x80 in direction-flag fields elsewhere in this document should be interpreted as legacy/spec behavior, not what this component actually sends on the wire

### Temperature Encoding
- Some units use raw Fahrenheit values without encoding
- Some units use Celsius encoding regardless of display setting
- The encoding formula may need adjustment for specific models

### Mode Values
- AUTO mode has been observed as both 0x80 and 0x91
- LOW fan has been observed as both 0x03 and 0x04
- Always test with your specific unit and adjust as needed

### Current Reading
- Current reading (byte 15) often returns 0xFF (invalid)
- Actual current measurement may not be supported on all models

### Extended Query
- QUERY_EXTENDED (0xC4) provides outdoor temperature and static pressure
- Not all fields in extended query response are fully understood
- Field interpretation may vary by model
