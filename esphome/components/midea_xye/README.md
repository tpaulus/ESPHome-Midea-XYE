# Overview

This component communicates with Midea-like air conditioners (heat pumps) via the XYE protocol over RS-485.

For detailed protocol documentation, see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

Kudos to these projects:
- Reverse engineering of the protocol: https://codeberg.org/xye/xye
- Working implementation using ESP32: https://github.com/Bunicutz/ESP32_Midea_RS485
- Working implementation by wtahler: https://github.com/wtahler/esphome-mideaXYE-rs485
- Fully integrated Midea Climate component: https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/dev/esphome/components/midea

To get this to work you need an esphome configuration like this:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: heatpump
  friendly_name: Heatpump

esp8266:  #also works with esp32
  board: d1_mini

# Enable logging (but not via UART)
logger:
  baud_rate: 0
  # Optional: Enable debug logging for XYE protocol messages
  # logs:
  #   midea_xye: DEBUG

# What works
- Setting mode (off, auto, fan, cool, heat, dry).
- Setting temperature. Can send in C or F. Handles AC results in C or F. Must manually set in YAML.
- Setting fan mode (auto, low, med, high).
- Reading inside, outside air temperatures, inside coil temperature, and outside coil temperature.
- Reading timer start/stop times (set by remote)
- Follow-Me temperature. Point it at a sensor and this works well.

# What doesn't work
- Current reading always shows 255
- Setting swing mode 

# Not yet implemented
- Setting timers direct to unit. No real need since automations can do this 
- Figure out how to force display to C or F. Setting temp in C doesn't force display to C.
- Freeze protection
- Silent mode
- Lock/Unlock

# Not tested
- IR integration (However, not needed for Follow-Me)
